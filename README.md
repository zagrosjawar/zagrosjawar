## About me

With a rich background ranging from law at the University of Aleppo to Information Science at the University of Bergen, I've evolved through diverse roles—from a primary school teacher to an experienced freelance interpreter. 

Currently, I'm expanding my expertise into media and interaction design, aiming for a third bachelor's degree. 

My journey reflects a disciplined commitment to continuous learning and personal growth. 

As a team-oriented problem solver, I'm eager to dive into UX/UI, front-end, back-end, or full-stack opportunities, always striving to exceed expectations and gain comprehensive experience.
